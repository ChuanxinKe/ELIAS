# ELIAS
Helloï¼Œthis is part of my disertation. ELIAS is eLearning Interactive Course & Assessment Software.
It was created as prototype by using Axure. This repository contains the text mining program, social media data and coded online learning data used.
All these sources were used for the understanding of user requirements.
